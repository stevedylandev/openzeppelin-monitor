= RPC Client
:description: Documentation for the RPC client implementation and endpoint management features.


== Overview

The OpenZeppelin Monitor includes a robust RPC client implementation with automatic endpoint rotation and fallback capabilities. This ensures reliable blockchain monitoring even when individual RPC endpoints experience issues.

* Multiple RPC endpoint support with weighted load balancing
* Automatic fallback on endpoint failures
* Rate limit handling (429 responses)
* Connection health checks
* Thread-safe endpoint rotation

== Configuration

=== RPC URLs

RPC endpoints are configured in the network configuration files with weights for load balancing:

[source,json]
----
{
  "rpc_urls": [
    {
      "type_": "rpc",
      "url": "https://primary-endpoint.example.com",
      "weight": 100
    },
    {
      "type_": "rpc",
      "url": "https://backup-endpoint.example.com",
      "weight": 50
    }
  ]
}
----

[TIP]
====
For high-availability setups, configure at least 3 (private) RPC endpoints with appropriate weights to ensure continuous operation even if multiple endpoints fail.

== Endpoint Management

The endpoint manager handles

* Initial endpoint selection based on weights
* Automatic rotation on failures
* Connection health checks
* Thread-safe endpoint updates

=== Rotation Strategy

The RPC client includes an automatic rotation strategy for handling specific types of failures:

* For 429 (Too Many Requests) responses:
** Immediately rotates to a fallback URL
** Retries the request with the new endpoint
** Continues this process until successful or all endpoints are exhausted

==== Configuration Options

The error codes that trigger RPC endpoint rotation can be customized in the `src/services/blockchain/transports/mod.rs` file.

[source,rust]
----
pub const ROTATE_ON_ERROR_CODES: [u16; 1] = [429];
----

=== Retry Strategy

Each transport client implements `reqwest-retry` middleware with exponential backoff to handle transient failures in network requests. This is implemented separately from the endpoint rotation mechanism.

* For transient HTTP errors and network failures:
** Retries up to 3 times (configurable via `ExponentialBackoff` builder)
** Applies exponential backoff between retry attempts
** Returns the final error if all retry attempts fail
** Maintains the same URL throughout the retry process
** Independent from the endpoint rotation mechanism

Each blockchain network type has its own specialized transport client that wraps the base `HttpTransportClient`.
This architecture provides common HTTP functionality while allowing customization of network-specific behaviors like connection testing and retry policies.
The transport clients are implemented as:

1. *Base HTTP Transport*: `HttpTransportClient` provides core HTTP functionality
2. *Network-Specific Transports*:
   * `EVMTransportClient` for EVM networks
   * `StellarTransportClient` for Stellar networks
   * `MidnightTransportClient` for Midnight networks

==== Configuration Options

The retry policy can be customized using the `ExponentialBackoff` builder in the respective transport client. The default retry policy is:

[source,rust]
----
let retry_policy = ExponentialBackoff::builder()
  .base(2)
  .retry_bounds(Duration::from_millis(250), Duration::from_secs(10))
  .jitter(Jitter::Full)
  .build_with_max_retries(3);
----

The retry policy can be customized with the following options:

[source,rust]
----
pub struct ExponentialBackoff {
  pub max_n_retries: Option<u32>,     // Maximum number of allowed retries attempts.
  pub min_retry_interval: Duration,   // Minimum waiting time between two retry attempts (it can end up being lower when using full jitter).
  pub max_retry_interval: Duration,   // Maximum waiting time between two retry attempts.
  pub jitter: Jitter,                 // How we apply jitter to the calculated backoff intervals.
  pub base: u32,                      // Base of the exponential.
}
----

The retry mechanism is implemented at the transport level using a dual-client approach:

1. A base `reqwest` HTTP client is created with optimized configurations:
   * Connection pool settings for efficient resource usage
   * Configurable timeouts for request and connection handling
   * Shared across all transport operations

2. A cloned instance of this client is enhanced with middleware:
   * Wrapped with `reqwest_middleware` for retry capabilities
   * Configured with exponential backoff and jitter
   * Handles automatic retry logic for failed requests

This architecture ensures:

1. Direct requests (like health checks) use the base client for minimal overhead
2. RPC calls benefit from the middleware's retry capabilities
3. Both clients maintain efficiency by sharing the same connection pool


Each transport client may define its own retry policy:

[source,rust]
----

// src/services/transports/http.rs
pub struct HttpTransportClient {
  pub client: Arc<RwLock<Client>>,
  endpoint_manager: EndpointManager,
  test_connection_payload: Option<String>,
}

// Example of client creation with retry mechanism
let http_client = reqwest::ClientBuilder::new()
  .pool_idle_timeout(Duration::from_secs(90))
  .pool_max_idle_per_host(32)
  .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
  .connect_timeout(Duration::from_secs(20))
  .build()?;

// Create middleware client with retry policy
let client = ClientBuilder::new(cloned_http_client)
  .with(RetryTransientMiddleware::new_with_policy_and_strategy(
    retry_policy,
    RetryTransient,
  ))
  .build();

// src/services/transports/evm/http.rs
pub struct EVMTransportClient {
  http_client: HttpTransportClient,
}

// override with a custom retry policy and strategy
pub async fn new(network: &Network) -> Result<Self, anyhow::Error> {
  let test_connection_payload = Some(r#"{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_version","params":[]}"#.to_string());
  let http_client = HttpTransportClient::new(network, test_connection_payload).await?;
  http_client.set_retry_policy(
    ExponentialBackoff::builder().build_with_total_retry_duration(Duration::from_secs(10)),
    Some(DefaultRetryableStrategy),
  )?;
  Ok(Self { http_client })
}
----

=== Implementation Details
This retry and rotation strategies ensure optimal handling of different types of failures while maintaining service availability.

== List of RPC Calls

Below is a list of RPC calls made by the monitor for each network type for each iteration of the cron schedule.
As the number of blocks being processed increases, the number of RPC calls grows, potentially leading to rate limiting issues or increased costs if not properly managed.

* During block filtering, for each monitored contract without an ABI in config:
** Fetching contract instance data: `getLedgerEntries`
** Fetching contract WASM code: `getLedgerEntries`
* Fetching transactions (batched up to 200 in a single request): `getTransactions`

== Best Practices

* Configure multiple private endpoints with appropriate weights
* Use geographically distributed endpoints when possible
* Monitor endpoint health and adjust weights as needed
* Set appropriate retry policies based on network characteristics


== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

* *429 Too Many Requests*: Increase the number of fallback URLs, adjust weights or reduce monitoring frequency
* *Connection Timeouts*: Check endpoint health and network connectivity
* *Invalid Responses*: Verify endpoint compatibility with your network type

=== Logging

Enable debug logging for detailed transport information:

[source,bash]
----
RUST_LOG=debug
----

This will show:

* Endpoint rotations
* Connection attempts
* Request/response details
